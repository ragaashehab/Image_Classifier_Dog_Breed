4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:
All model architectures have pct_correct_dogs    : 100.0, and pct_correct_notdogs : 100.0
however, both alexnet and resnet have Total Elapsed Runtime: 0:0:0
I prefer the alexnet cause it has higher pct_match : 25.0 and lower run time.
but the dog labels should be written more carefully.
